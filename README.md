## **Event Propagation**

Welcome to **Branch 2.2** of the **React Lab**! In this branch, I’ve explored **React event propagation** to understand how events traverse React components and the importance of effectively managing this flow. I’ve also learned techniques to stop event propagation, experimented with passing handlers as an alternative, and investigated methods to prevent default behaviors in React applications.
