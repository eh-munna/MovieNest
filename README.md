## **State: A Component's Memory**

Welcome to **Branch 2.3** of the **React Lab**! In this branch, Iâ€™ve explored the concept of **React State** to understand how it serves as a component's memory, enabling components to dynamically preserve and update data. I learned how to use the `useState` hook to add state to React components, manage multiple state variables, and understand why state is considered local. This journey into React State has deepened my ability to build more dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

This branch includes:

- **Code examples** demonstrating how to implement and manage state in React components.
