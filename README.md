## 📌 Project Overview

**MovieNest** is a hands-on React project where I explored advanced concepts such as the **Reducer pattern** and **React Context API**. This project is part of my journey through React’s official documentation, aimed at gaining deep, practical understanding by combining **state management** and **component sharing**.

In this project, I focused on:

- Combining a **Reducer** with **Context**
- Managing **global state** efficiently
- Organizing React logic into a single, maintainable file
