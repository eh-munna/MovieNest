# **React Lab** ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2320232a?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

Welcome to the **React Lab**! This repository serves as my personal playground to explore and master the fundamentals of React. Each branch represents a focused learning environment for a specific React topic, with code examples, exercises, and documentation.

---

## **Overview**

The **React Lab** is structured to:

- **Practice React concepts** through hands-on coding exercises.
- **Document my learning journey** with detailed notes and observations.
- Build a **strong foundation in React** by breaking down topics into manageable sections.

The **`main`** branch acts as the central hub for documentation, while all the code and resources are organized across topic-specific branches.

---

## **Branch Organization**

Each branch contains:

- **Code examples** and exercises for the topic.
- **Summarized notes** with key points and insights in a `notes.md` file (if necessary).

---

## **How to Use the React Lab**

Each branch corresponds to a distinct React topic or concept. Branches are organized using a naming convention such as [branch number].[sub-branch number]. For example, code for Branch-1 Sub-1 is located in the `1.1` branch.

Follow the steps below to run different branches on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eh-munna/react-lab.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository folder:**

   ```bash
   cd react-lab
   ```

3. **Switch to a specific branch:**

   - For example, to switch to branch 1.1

   ```bash
   git checkout 1.1
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Follow the README instructions** in the branch to run the code.

## **Goals of the React Lab**

- Develop a **deep understanding of React fundamentals**.
- Practice React concepts **in isolation** to enhance focus.
- Create a comprehensive **repository of examples and notes** for future reference.
- Progress towards building **complex React projects** with confidence.
